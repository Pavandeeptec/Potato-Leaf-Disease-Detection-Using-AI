## 🎯 Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses Vision Transformer (ViT) for accurate disease classification
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Upload files or capture images with camera
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple images simultaneously
- **Professional Reports**: Export results as PDF or CSV
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast processing with confidence scores

## 🔬 Disease Classes

- **Healthy Leaves**: No disease detected
- **Early Blight**: Alternaria solani infection
- **Late Blight**: Phytophthora infestans infection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potato-disease-detection.git
cd potato-disease-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get the trained model:
   - **Option 1**: Train your own model using `train.py` (recommended)
   - **Option 2**: Download pre-trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/your-model-link)
   - Place the model file as `potato_disease_model.pth` in the root directory

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔧 Training Your Own Model

1. Prepare your dataset in the following structure:
```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── Potato___Early_blight/
│   ├── Potato___Late_blight/
│   └── Potato___healthy/
└── val/
    ├── Potato___Early_blight/
    ├── Potato___Late_blight/
    └── Potato___healthy/
```

2. Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Architecture**: Vision Transformer (ViT-Base-Patch16-224)
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ on validation set
- **Processing Time**: 2-3 seconds per image
- **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, JPEG

## 🌐 API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main web interface
- `POST /predict` - Image analysis endpoint
- `POST /export` - Report generation endpoint

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage**: Images are processed in memory only
- **Local Processing**: AI runs on your server, not in the cloud
- **Secure Uploads**: File validation and sanitization
- **HTTPS Ready**: Camera access requires secure connection
